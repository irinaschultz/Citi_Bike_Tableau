Based on the data analysis of demographic statistics, it appears that the active users of the CitiBike service are predominantly from the Millennial generation, which typically includes individuals born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s. This generation seems to have a higher acceptance and usage of the democratic bike riding service compared to the Gen X (born roughly between the mid-1960s and early 1980s) and Gen Z (born roughly between the mid-1990s and early 2010s) generations.
The reasons for this higher acceptance among Millennials could be attributed to various factors:
1.Tech-Savvy and Convenience: Millennials are known for their familiarity and comfort with technology.
2.Eco-Consciousness and Wellness: Millennials tend to be more environmentally conscious. 
3.Urban Lifestyle: Millennials are more likely to live in urban areas with shorter distances. 
The Citi Bike's public data indicates that men are indeed riding the bike-sharing service more frequently than women, averaging three times more rides. 
The number of male subscribers are higher than female subscribers, and subscribers, in general, tend to use the service more frequently than casual or non-subscriber customers.
It appears that there are two high peaks in trip duration activities during the day:
Morning Peak (7-8 AM): During this time, there is a significant increase in trip duration activities. This can be attributed to people using bike-sharing services for their morning commute to work. 
Evening Peak (4-7 PM): The period between 4 PM and 7 PM shows another significant increase in trip duration activities. This corresponds to the evening rush hour when people are returning home from work or other activities. The presence of these two high peaks in trip duration activities indicates that bike-sharing services are meeting the demands of daily commuters, providing a reliable and efficient transportation option during rush hours. 
The popularity of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday as the most popular days for Citi Bike users is not surprising and is consistent with general commuting patterns and routines.
Analyse the ten most popular start and end stations and mapping them provided valuable insights into the usage patterns of Citi Bike in the city's Central Business District (CBD). 
The data trends for Citi Bike usage in 2020 show an expansion of active users starting to use the service in the Bronx compared to the previous two years. This trend indicates that Citi Bike's popularity and availability extended to the Bronx borough during 2020, attracting more users to use the bike-sharing service in that area.
